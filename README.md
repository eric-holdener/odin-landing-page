# odin-landing-page

This is a project tasked by The Odin Project to create a fully styled landing page from scratch, utilizing a reference picture.

Methods being employed include: HTML, CSS, Flexbox for CSS

Reflection:
This project took me quite a while to work through, trying to figure out the best course of action for a responsive flex based landing page. I am also almost positive that how I accomplished these tasks could be very improved with more practice and skill, so I do plan on revisiting this project later on after I have more practice in CSS to see if I notice any big glaring issues in how I laid out the page. Overall though, I'm proud that I was able to accomplish this - I've never been able to do relatively anything with CSS, so this is a nice change of pace that I am proud of.
